BORK: A Text Based Adventure Game<br/>
Bork is a classic Role-Playing game emanating the essence of Dungeons and Dragons 
with a hint of the “Zork” play-style by incorporating text adventure aspects with 
a few GUI elements to introduce a blend of gameplay mechanics we believe will be 
most enjoyable. The game is centered on the perspective of a dog whose found 
themselves in a medieval plane of existence with creatures and monsters. In the 
treacherous unforgiving lands players can interact with objects in their surroundings, 
battle enemies, and attempt to beat the game by escaping the area.<br/>
